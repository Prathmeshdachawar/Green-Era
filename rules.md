# Project Green-Era

## Overview:

This project involves styling multiple pages using CSS. Before adding styles to the pages, follow these guidelines:

## Instructions:

### 1. Structuring Elements:

When working on a specific page, follow these steps for better organization:

- If you are working on **Page 1**, use the following notation to add children elements:
  ```css
  /* Ayush Yadav */
  #page1 > {
      /* Your styles for child elements on Page 1 */
  }
Similarly, replace #page1 with the appropriate ID when working on other pages.
2. Commenting Your Name:
Please comment your name above the CSS block you are working on. This helps in identifying the owner or contributor of specific styles for better collaboration.

Example:
css
Copy code
/* Ayush Yadav */
#page1 {
    height: 100vh;
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgb(103, 58, 183), rgb(186, 104, 200), rgb(229, 204, 255));
}
By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a clear and organized structure throughout the project. Happy styling!
